# About Matt Kolon


- This is my personal site, in place of most social media. 

- My email is [**matt@kolon.org**](mailto:matt@kolon.org). I'm also [**boingit.88**](https://signal.me/#eu/0mnzJONCOTGpVnbYwZp3Q4Pesw5uaf-yKadA9FenBbIs76iw4CdI0qzSCuQdIvke) on [**Signal**](https://signal.org/).

- Thank God I'm married to the amazing artist [**Patty Hudak**](https://www.pattyhudak.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

    - Our offspring are limited to the unlimited [**Carl Kolon**](https://carlkolon.com){:target="_blank"} and [**Nellie Kolon**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-nellie-kolon-8b4b3613a/){:target="_blank"}.

    - Patty and I see [**many operas**](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oTQZExHTHNWzuFFu7){:target="_blank"} together, mostly at [**The Met**](https://www.metopera.org/){:target="_blank"} in NYC.
    
    - Between 2005 and 2017 we lived in [香港](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong "Hong Kong"), [北京](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing "Beijing"), and [東京](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo").

    - We now live near Vermont's [**Mt Mansfield**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mansfield){:target="_blank"}. I sometimes [**take pictures**](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5XAN8cZtD3x7Abu79){:target="_blank"} of it.
    
    - In Beijing we somehow acquired a cat. She has followed us across three<br>countries and an ocean. She [likes dessert](/assets/kiki.mov) and has [quite a pedigree](/assets/kiki.png).
  
- [**Hill Associates**](https://www.hillvt.com/){:target="_blank"} creates programs that teach people how to build, run, secure, sell,<br>and regulate telecommunications and networking solutions. I'm the CTO there.

- Often with the help of some LLM-based artificial intelligence, [I write a bit of code](https://github.com/mkolon).

- Various (mostly outdoor) [**sports activities**](https://www.strava.com/athletes/25264732){:target="_blank"} are regular preoccupations. 

- A busy middle age interrupted my youthful reading addiction, which I'm [**now feeding again**](https://bit.ly/3Zstavx){:target="_blank"}. 

- The eternal genius [**Claude Shannon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) and I graduated from the same [high school](https://ghs.gaylordschools.com/), 52 years apart.
