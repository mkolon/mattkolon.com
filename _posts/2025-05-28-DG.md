Herding the cats for a DG field trip this fall.

***


Dudes,

I want to fulfill my promise on this topic—and I’m genuinely excited about the potential outcome—so here are a few thoughts on a possible *Don Giovanni* field trip.

Patty and I have tickets for the October 25 matinee performance of [*Don Giovanni*](https://www.metopera.org/season/2025-26-season/don-giovanni/) at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City (1:00 p.m.). That’s right, it’s a matinee! As you know, we see a lot of operas, and this will be our first of the new season. We saw the same production last year and signed up again because it was just that good.

Yes, the Met is always great, but we chose *Don Giovanni* again for another reason: it’s arguably the greatest opera ever written. Really—if you could only see one opera in your life, this might be the one. There are some close contenders, but it's especially true if you lean dark and cynical and aren’t looking for easy answers. The combination of *Don Giovanni*, at the Met, in NYC, in late October (especially for Vermonters) is simply too good to pass up.

If you’re curious about what you’d be in for, here are some resources:

For those who end up joining us and are interested, Patty and I have a lot more to say if you want to hear it. Here's a [link to our plans](https://mattkolon.com/2025/04/01/met.html) for the entire 25-26 season.

**Be Aware:**  
*Don Giovanni* is a popular opera, and tickets can sell out. They're also cheaper (and come with better seat options) if you buy early—same goes for hotels. So the sooner you commit, the better. If enough of us go, we could also plan dinner or other activities.

Since we're Met subscribers, I can buy your tickets now—they won’t be available to the general public until sometime in later June I believe. There are lots of seating and pricing options available, but expect to spend $200–300 per ticket. Patty and I usually get Dress Circle seats, which I recommend as a good balance of price and experience. But pick whatever suits you—it’s the same show either way.

**Accommodations:**  
I don’t have specific hotel recommendations, but I suggest avoiding Times Square. It’s overrun with tourists (and the blech that comes with them). While TS is convenient, you’ll likely have a better experience staying elsewhere. I’m happy to offer more brutally honest biases if you want help choosing between various options you've found.

You’ll probably want to stay the nights of October 24 and 25, but do what works for you. One night in NYC isn’t really enough—even with a matinee. In terms of travel, Patty and I usually drive to New Haven, park at the station there, and take the Metro North train into Grand Central. Flights can be cheap in October, too, so that's worth checking. Could you fly in, see the show, and fly out the same day? Technically yes. Should you? Absolutely not.

So **Who’s in?** I’ll hassle you at the next UMLS meeting, but feel free to make your own arrangements if you'd rather. No gatekeeping here. I just hope everyone’s in, with your wifeys, and we can have a big opera party in the city while the last Vermont leaves vanish in the rain. I'm okay missing that part.

**Rispondetemi!**  
(Peter is likely the only one who'll get the reference right away, but you all will after you see DG.)
