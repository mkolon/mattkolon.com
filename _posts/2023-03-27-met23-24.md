title: Met Opera Database 23-24

As I mentioned last year, Patty and I see a lot of opera, usually at [The Met](https://www.metopera.org/) in New York. There's much detail in the operatic canon, so when deciding which tickets to purchase from the long Met season schedule, it sometimes helps to have a summary of what's on the menu. 

***

So I again made a cheat sheet for next season, a screen shot of which is below. You can also [access the Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dYLSKaXYwBemL1CfppTpl6xRJLakVqh-aBV87xPuzvA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} if you wish to remix or have display issues with the png. I think most of the data is correct; please let me know if you find a mistake. My one-line synopsis and "Hero's Fate" columns are...frivolous, for which I apologize to the Met and generations of opera-goers more serious than I. But I mean really, if you're not (yet) a fan, it seems to me the last column is reason enough to become one.

Last year saw many drownings, but this season stabbing has really come to the fore.

In the current season we happily still have two performances left to see: Terence Blanchard's _Champion_ and Mozart's _Don Giovanni_. For the 23-24 season, we'll be seeing the ones in green below.
