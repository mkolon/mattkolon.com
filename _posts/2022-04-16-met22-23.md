title: Met Opera Database 22-23
---

For people our age, Patty and I see a lot of opera, usually at [The Met](https://www.metopera.org/) in New York. There's much detail in the operatic canon, so when deciding which tickets to purchase from the long Met season schedule, it sometimes helps to have a summary of what's on the menu. 

***

So I made a cheat sheet for next season, a screen shot of which is below. You can also [access the Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dYLSKaXYwBemL1CfppTpl6xRJLakVqh-aBV87xPuzvA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} if you wish to remix or have display issues with the png. I think most of the data is correct; please let me know if you find a mistake. My one-line synopsis and "Hero's Fate" columns are...frivolous, for which I apologize to the Met and generations of opera-goers more serious than I. But I mean really, if you're not (yet) a fan, it seems to me the last column is reason enough to become one.

In the current season we happily still have two performances left to see: Stravinsky's _The Rake's Progress_ and Phillip Glass' _Akhnaten_. For the 22-23 season, we'll be seeing the ones in green below.
