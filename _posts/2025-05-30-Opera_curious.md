## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Isn't opera a stuffy, elite, annoying, snooty snob-fest?
A: No. Opera is whatever you want it to be. If you want to dress up, you can, and you can buy overpriced champagne and snacks, or eat in the fancy cafe. But unless it's a gala premiere or other special event, the Met is pretty chill. We love opera and think it's a bit special, so tend to [dress in not-jeans](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOnmyRT9zl2K7GrFnD2j2q2quYIb2FLLj-dFSin8afJo-R-kZm8zu4_QttxU3zuwA?key=eFNlb21XeHpNa2hRSU9MRVpYZUFiVDVnMHFQWWdR), but plenty of people just come as they are.

### Q: Why not go to a Broadway show, or game at the Garden, instead?
A: Indeed, why not? We'll meet you afterwards! But opera is a unique kind of entertainment that combines music and drama in ways that nothing else does.

Also always featuring the best musicians in the world, on the stage and in the pit. You can see some great shows, but also lots of crap on Broadway. You will never see crap at the Met. 

### Q: How do you know what's going on if you don't speak the language?
A: Even when the opera is in English, it's usually tough to understand. Singers emphasize tone and melody over comprehensability. Luckily, there are awesome "Met titles" in a display on the back of the seat in front of you, where you can see a translation of what's being sung in real time. You can also shut it off. 

### Q: What about rush tickets? You know, the $50 ones they sell just before the curtain?
A: Great idea, but hard to plan. One never knows if there will be any sold at all, or where they will be located. A nice way to fill some last-minute dead time if you're already in the city, but not a great idea to plan a trip around.
