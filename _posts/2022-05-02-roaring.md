The idea that the COVID-19 pandemic (should it ever end) will be followed by the Raucous Roaring '20s is something we can all get behind, but even spontaneity requires some planning. (?) To that end, here are some plans for The Crushers and our friends for the balance of this decade.

- 23: Hok Skiing in the UP / Porcupine Mountains __\|\|__ Dr Gee's Wyoming Bike Adventure 
- 24: 
- 25: Iceland Volcano Bathing. Not really, but something like that.
- 26: Haute Route Chamonix Zermatt AT Tour __\|\|__ Vermont Long Trail E2E Hike
- 27: Tour Divide Bikepacking

There's a lot to settle regarding details, so watch this space as it all comes together. Crushers July '22 in VT should provide much opportunity to make plans for the rest of the decade.
