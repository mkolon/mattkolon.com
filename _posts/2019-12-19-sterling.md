But this pic, taken by my son Carl, makes me look like one, so I posted it here. This was [a few weeks ago](https://www.strava.com/activities/2942928438) when Carl and I decided to go across the pond to Stowe.

It was -7Â°F when we started climbing, no idea what it was when this pic was taken, but it was cold. That's Sterling Pond near the top of Sterling Mountain in the background.
