title: Met Opera Database 24-25
---

Back by popular demand, here's the third edition of our list of operas we plan to see this season at [The Met](https://www.metopera.org/). We've splashed out a bit and have tickets to see seven, one more than usual.

***

Below is a screen shot of the season and our choices, which are the ones in green. You can also [access the Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dYLSKaXYwBemL1CfppTpl6xRJLakVqh-aBV87xPuzvA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} if you wish to remix or have display issues with the png. Please let me know if you find a mistake. My one-line synopsis and "Hero's Fate" columns are...frivolous. But I mean really, if you're not (yet) an opera fan, it seems to me the last column is reason enough to become one.

Last season saw way too man stabbings! I'm happy to report that this season seems a bit kinder, with no clear winner in manner of death, and fewer deaths overall. Who says the world is falling apart?

Maybe next year we'll put a "why we picked it" column in the already-overwrought database, but for now: We like to see new operas and productions, which explains the first five. Hoffmann is a classic neither of us has ever seen, and the crazy [Doll's Aria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXKsOeccz8w) is being sung this year by Erin Morely, the soprano in the video

As far as Figaro is concerned, it's just one of our (and everyone's) favorites, and it's been a while since we saw it. It's also being conducted by Joana Mallwitz in her Met debut.
